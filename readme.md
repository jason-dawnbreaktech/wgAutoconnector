## This script is pretty simple. The 'TrustedSSIDs' variable can be altered to include the Wi-Fi connections that you trust. While connected to one of these networks, the VPN will disconnect automatically to ensure your traffic isn't being slowed down unecessarily. 

Please ignore or delete my meme comments that pop up while the script is running. Had a bit of fun after loling at the missile memes. If you're hyper concerned with security then you can alter the script to repeat on any number 

        # Wait 30 seconds then try again    
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 30

        Example:

                # Wait 1 seconds then try again    
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 1

The try catch block at the end of the script ensures that the VPN is disconnected when you exit out of the Powershell window.
